# A-Kinetic-Assisted-Growth-Curve-Prediction-Method-
"A Kinetic-Assisted Growth Curve Prediction Method for Chlamydomonas reinhardtii Incorporating Transfer Learning". We constructed a kinetic model of microalgae growth considering light-dark cycle and four machine learning models were used as base learners curve prediction under small-sample conditions using Two-stage Tradaboost.
